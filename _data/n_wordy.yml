- question: "A farmer sells $\\frac{1}{2}$ of his land. He then gives $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining land to his son. What fraction of the original land does the farmer still own?"
  solution: "After selling land, the farmer has $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$ of his land left. He gives away $\\frac{1}{3}$ of this remainder, which is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}$ of the original land. The farmer started with $\\frac{1}{2}$ remaining and gave away $\\frac{1}{6}$, so he now has $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$."

- question: "A garden is $\\frac{1}{3}$ lawn and $\\frac{1}{4}$ flowers. The rest is a vegetable patch. What fraction is the vegetable patch?"
  solution: "Find the total fraction for lawn and flowers. The lowest common denominator is 12. Lawn: $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{12}$. Flowers: $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{12}$. Total: $\\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{7}{12}$. The vegetable patch is the remainder: $1 - \\frac{7}{12} = \\frac{5}{12}$."
  answer: "$\\frac{5}{12}$"
- question: "A container is $\\frac{5}{6}$ full. $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the contents are used. What fraction of the original container is left?"
  solution: "We need to find what is left after using $\\frac{1}{2}$ of $\\frac{5}{6}$. The amount used is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{12}$. The amount remaining is the original amount minus the amount used: $\\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{5}{12} = \\frac{10}{12} - \\frac{5}{12} = \\frac{5}{12}$."
  answer: "$\\frac{5}{12}$"
- question: "Of 60 people at a party, $\\frac{1}{3}$ have black hair and $\\frac{1}{4}$ have blonde hair. How many people have neither black nor blonde hair?"
