  solution: "Add the equations: $6x=18 \\implies x=3$. Substitute back: $2(3)-y=1 \\implies 6-y=1 \\implies y=5$."
  answer: "$x=3, y=5$"
- question: "Solve the simultaneous equations: $2x + 3y = 8$ and $x + 2y = 5$."
  solution: "Multiply second by 2: $2x+4y=10$. Subtract first from this: $y=2$. Substitute back: $x+2(2)=5 \\implies x+4=5 \\implies x=1$."
  answer: "$x=1, y=2$"
- question: "Solve the simultaneous equations: $3x + y = 20$ and $x + y = 10$."
  solution: "Subtract second from first: $2x=10 \\implies x=5$. Substitute back: $5+y=10 \\implies y=5$."
  answer: "$x=5, y=5$"
- question: "Solve the simultaneous equations: $x + 4y = 14$ and $2x + y = 5$."
  solution: "Multiply second by 4: $8x+4y=20$. Subtract first from this: $7x=6 \\implies x=6/7$. Substitute back: $2(6/7)+y=5 \\implies 12/7+y=35/7 \\implies y=23/7$."
  answer: "$x=6/7, y=23/7$"
- question: "Solve the simultaneous equations: $4x - y = 7$ and $x + 2y = 10$."
  solution: "Multiply first by 2: $8x-2y=14$. Add to second: $9x=24 \\implies x=24/9=8/3$. Substitute back: $8/3+2y=10 \\implies 2y=30/3-8/3=22/3 \\implies y=11/3$."
  answer: "$x=8/3, y=11/3$"
- question: "Solve the simultaneous equations: $x + y = 6$ and $x - y = 0$."
  solution: "Add the equations: $2x=6 \\implies x=3$. Substitute back: $3+y=6 \\implies y=3$."
  answer: "$x=3, y=3$"
- question: "Solve the simultaneous equations: $5x + 2y = 9$ and $2x + y = 4$."
  solution: "Multiply second by 2: $4x+2y=8$. Subtract this from first: $x=1$. Substitute back: $2(1)+y=4 \\implies y=2$."
  answer: "$x=1, y=2$"
