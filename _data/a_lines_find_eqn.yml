- question: "Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (1, 2) and (2, 4)."
  solution: "Gradient: $m = \\frac{4-2}{2-1} = 2$. Use $y=2x+c$ with (1, 2): $2 = 2(1) + c \\implies c=0$."
  answer: "$y = 2x$"
- question: "Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (4, 0) and (2, 1)."
  solution: "Gradient: $m = \\frac{1-0}{2-4} = \\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Use $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+c$ with (4, 0): $0 = -\\frac{1}{2}(4) + c \\implies 0 = -2 + c \\implies c=2$."
  answer: "$y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + 2$"
- question: "Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (-2, -2) and (-1, -1)."
  solution: "Gradient: $m = \\frac{-1-(-2)}{-1-(-2)} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$. Use $y=x+c$ with (-1, -1): $-1 = -1 + c \\implies c=0$."
  answer: "$y = x$"
- question: "Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (0, -3) and (1, -1)."
  solution: "(0, -3) is the y-intercept, so $c=-3$. Gradient: $m = \\frac{-1-(-3)}{1-0} = 2$."
  answer: "$y = 2x - 3$"
- question: "Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (-2, 4) and (1, 1)."
  solution: "Gradient: $m = \\frac{4-1}{-2-1} = \\frac{3}{-3} = -1$. Use $y=-x+c$ with (1, 1): $1 = -1(1) + c \\implies c=2$."
  answer: "$y = -x + 2$"
- question: "Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (5, 2) and (1, -2)."
  solution: "Gradient: $m = \\frac{2-(-2)}{5-1} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$. Use $y=x+c$ with (1, -2): $-2 = 1 + c \\implies c=-3$."
  answer: "$y = x - 3$"
- question: "Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (10, 3) and (0, -2)."
  solution: "(0, -2) is the y-intercept, so $c=-2$. Gradient: $m = \\frac{3-(-2)}{10-0} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$."
