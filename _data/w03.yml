  parts:
    - part_label: "a"
      text: "Which of the graphs below would best represent this?"
      solution: "The problem describes a stepped cost, not a continuous line. A line passing through the origin ($C=20E$) is a common but imperfect simplification."
      answer: "None of the graphs perfectly represent the scenario as described."
    - part_label: "b"
      text: "The manager also considers an alternative pricing structure. They offer a membership price of £20, and thereafter it only costs £12 per entry. Which of the graphs above would best represent this?"
      solution: "This is represented by the equation $C = 12E + 20$. This has a positive y-intercept (£20) and a positive gradient (£12)."
      answer: "Graph A"
    - part_label: "c"
      text: "For the unselected graph, what would be a suitable scenario for this?"
      solution: "Graph B has a negative y-intercept, implying a discount. Graph C has a negative gradient, implying a decreasing value."
      answer: "Graph B: A service with a sign-up discount. Graph C: The declining balance on a gift card."
    - part_label: "d"
      text: "Write down the equation of the line from part a above, using $C$ to represent cost and $E$ to represent entries, with $C$ being the subject of the equation."
      answer: "$C = 20E$"
    - part_label: "e"
      text: "Write down the equation of the line, using the same format as d, for the line from part b above."
      answer: "$C = 12E + 20$"
    - part_label: "f"
      text: "For each of the two pricing structures, what would be the cost of using the gym on 4 occasions?"
      solution: "Structure 1: $C = 20 \\times 4 = 80$. Structure 2: $C = (12 \\times 4) + 20 = 48 + 20 = 68$."
      answer: "Structure 1: £80. Structure 2: £68."
    - part_label: "g"
      text: "If a customer has £100, what is the maximum number of times they can attend the gym, for both pricing structures?"
      solution: "Structure 1: $100 \\div 20 = 5$. Structure 2: $100 - 20 = 80$. $80 \\div 12 \\approx 6.67$. So, 6 complete entries."
      answer: "Structure 1: 5 times. Structure 2: 6 times."
    - part_label: "h"
      text: "Solve the two equations simultaneously, and comment on what this would mean for the customer."
      solution: "Set equations equal: $20E = 12E + 20 \\implies 8E = 20 \\implies E = 2.5$. The cost is the same at 2.5 entries. For 3 or more entries, Structure 2 is cheaper."
      answer: "$E=2.5$. Structure 2 becomes cheaper from the 3rd entry onwards."
