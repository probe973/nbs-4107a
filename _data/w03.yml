    a. Sketch each pair on a single graph, labeling the points where the lines cross the axes (you will need to determine these).
    b. Solve them as simultaneous equations.
    c. The solution to the simultaneous equations is the point where the two lines cross. Label this point on your sketch.

  sub_questions:
    - part_label: "a"
      question: "Which of the graphs below would best represent this?"
      solution: "The cost would be represented by a series of steps, not a line. However, if we were modelling average cost, a line through the origin ($C=20E$) could be an approximation."
      answer: "None of these are perfect representations of the scenario."
    - part_label: "b"
      question: "The manager also considers an alternative pricing structure. They offer a membership price of £20, and thereafter it only costs £12 per entry. Which of the graphs above would best represent this?"
      solution: "This has a fixed starting cost of £20 (the y-intercept) and then rises at a constant rate of £12 per entry (the gradient)."
      answer: "Graph A"
    - part_label: "c"
      question: "For the unselected graph, what would be a suitable scenario for this?"
      solution: "Graph C shows a value that starts high and decreases at a constant rate, like the remaining value on a gift card. Graph B shows a cost that starts with a discount (negative intercept) and then increases."
      answer: "Graph C: The value remaining on a pre-paid card. Graph B: A service with a sign-up bonus."
    - part_label: "d"
      question: "Write down the equation of the line from part a above, using $C$ to represent cost and $E$ to represent entries, with $C$ being the subject of the equation."
      solution: "The cost is £20 multiplied by the number of entries."
      answer: "$C = 20E$"
    - part_label: "e"
      question: "Write down the equation of the line, using the same format as d, for the line from part b above."
      solution: "The cost is a fixed fee of £20 plus £12 multiplied by the number of entries."
      answer: "$C = 12E + 20$"
    - part_label: "f"
      question: "For each of the two pricing structures, what would be the cost of using the gym on 4 occasions?"
      solution: "Structure 1: $C = 20 \\times 4 = 80$. Structure 2: $C = (12 \\times 4) + 20 = 48 + 20 = 68$."
      answer: "Structure 1: £80. Structure 2: £68."
    - part_label: "g"
      question: "If a customer has £100, what is the maximum number of times they can attend the gym, for both pricing structures?"
      solution: "Structure 1: $100 \\div 20 = 5$. Structure 2: $100 - 20 = 80$. $80 \\div 12 \\approx 6.67$. So, 6 complete entries."
      answer: "Structure 1: 5 times. Structure 2: 6 times."
    - part_label: "h"
      question: "Solve the two equations simultaneously, and comment on what this would mean for the customer."
      solution: "Set the equations equal: $20E = 12E + 20$. Subtract $12E$: $8E = 20$. Solve for E: $E = 2.5$. This means the cost is identical for 2.5 entries. For 2 entries or fewer, Structure 1 is cheaper. For 3 entries or more, Structure 2 is cheaper."
      answer: "$E=2.5$. The cost is the same at 2.5 entries. Structure 2 becomes cheaper from the 3rd entry onwards."
