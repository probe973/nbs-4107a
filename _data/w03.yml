      question: "Solve the two equations simultaneously and comment on the meaning."
      solution: "Set the equations equal: $20E = 12E + 20$. Subtract $12E$: $8E = 20$. Solve for E: $E = 2.5$. This means the cost is identical for 2.5 entries. For 2 entries or fewer, Structure 1 is cheaper. For 3 entries or more, Structure 2 is cheaper."
