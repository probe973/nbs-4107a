  questions:
  - question: "Round 5.8713 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)."
    solution: "To round to 2 decimal places, we look at the third decimal place, which is 1. Since this is less than 5, we round down, which means we keep the second decimal place as it is."
    answer: "5.87"
  - question: "Round 15.1119 to 2 d.p."
    solution: "To round to 2 decimal places, we look at the third decimal place, which is 1. Since this is less than 5, we round down, keeping the second decimal place as it is."
    answer: "15.11"
  - question: "Round 18.7461 to 2 d.p."
    solution: "To round to 2 decimal places, we look at the third decimal place, which is 6. Since this is 5 or more, we round up. The second decimal place (4) becomes 5."
    answer: "18.75"
  - question: "Round 0.878 to 2 d.p."
    solution: "To round to 2 decimal places, we look at the third decimal place, which is 8. Since this is 5 or more, we round up. The second decimal place (7) becomes 8."
    answer: "0.88"
  - question: "Round 16.74991 to 1 d.p."
    solution: "To round to 1 decimal place, we look at the second decimal place, which is 4. Since this is less than 5, we round down, keeping the first decimal place as it is."
    answer: "16.7"
  - question: "Round 4.06597 to 3 d.p."
    solution: "To round to 3 decimal places, we look at the fourth decimal place, which is 9. Since this is 5 or more, we round up. The third decimal place (5) becomes 6."
    answer: "4.066"
  - question: "Round 14.9811 to 1 d.p."
    solution: "To round to 1 decimal place, we look at the second decimal place, which is 8. Since this is 5 or more, we round up. Rounding up the 9 in the first decimal place causes a carry-over, changing 14.9 to 15.0."
    answer: "15.0"
  - question: "Round 14.583 to 3 significant figures (s.f.)."
    solution: "The first three significant figures are 1, 4, and 5. The next digit is 8. Since this is 5 or more, we round up the last significant figure (5 becomes 6)."
    answer: "14.6"
  - question: "Round 4.14448 to 3 s.f."
    solution: "The first three significant figures are 4, 1, and 4. The next digit is 4. Since this is less than 5, we round down, keeping the last significant figure as it is."
    answer: "4.14"
  - question: "Round 654,329 to 3 s.f."
    solution: "The first three significant figures are 6, 5, and 4. The next digit is 3. Since this is less than 5, we round down, keeping the 4 and replacing the remaining digits with zeros to maintain the number's magnitude."
    answer: "654,000"
  - question: "Round 478.3 to 2 s.f."
    solution: "The first two significant figures are 4 and 7. The next digit is 8. Since this is 5 or more, we round up the last significant figure (7 becomes 8) and replace the rest with a zero before the decimal point."
    answer: "480"
  - question: "Round 56.39 to 2 s.f."
    solution: "The first two significant figures are 5 and 6. The next digit is 3. Since this is less than 5, we round down, keeping the last significant figure as it is."
    answer: "56"
  - question: "Round 0.00467 to 1 s.f."
    solution: "The first significant figure is 4 (we don't count the leading zeros). The next digit is 6. Since this is 5 or more, we round up the 4 to a 5."
    answer: "0.005"
  - question: "Round 498.9 to 2 s.f."
    solution: "The first two significant figures are 4 and 9. The next digit is 8. Since this is 5 or more, we round up the 9, which carries over, changing 49 to 50. We must add a zero to maintain the magnitude."
    answer: "500"

- section_title: "Percentages"
  questions:
  - question: "Find 45% of £20."
    solution: "To find 45%, you can find 10% (£2), multiply by 4 to get 40% (£8), then find 5% (£1) and add them together. £8 + £1 = £9. Alternatively, calculate $0.45 \\times 20$."
    answer: "£9"
  - question: "Find 75% of £150."
    solution: "75% is the same as $\\frac{3}{4}$. First find $\\frac{1}{4}$ of £150, which is $150 \\div 4 = 37.5$. Then multiply by 3: $37.5 \\times 3 = 112.5$. Alternatively, calculate $0.75 \\times 150$."
    answer: "£112.50"
  - question: "Find 28% of £25."
    solution: "This is the same as finding 25% of £28. 25% is one quarter. One quarter of 28 is $28 \\div 4 = 7$. Alternatively, calculate $0.28 \\times 25$."
    answer: "£7"
  - question: "Find 140% of £60."
    solution: "140% means the original amount plus an extra 40%. 100% is £60. 10% is £6, so 40% is $4 \\times 6 = 24$. The total is £60 + £24 = £84. Alternatively, calculate $1.4 \\times 60$."
    answer: "£84"

- section_title: "Ratio"
  questions:
  - question: "The ratio of red counters to blue counters is 3:5. Given there are 96 counters in total, how many of the counters are blue?"
    solution: "First, find the total number of parts in the ratio: $3 + 5 = 8$ parts. Then, find the value of one part by dividing the total number of counters by the number of parts: $96 \\div 8 = 12$ counters per part. Blue counters account for 5 parts, so multiply $5 \\times 12 = 60$."
    answer: "60"
  - question: "The ratio of left-handed people to right-handed people in a room is 2:7. Given there are 28 right-handed people, how many people are in the room in total?"
    solution: "The 28 right-handed people represent the 7 parts of the ratio. First, find the value of one part: $28 \\div 7 = 4$ people per part. The total number of parts in the ratio is $2 + 7 = 9$. The total number of people is $9 \\times 4 = 36$."
    answer: "36"
  - question: "In a workforce there are 1.5 times as many full-time employees as part-time employees. Given that there are 120 people employed, how many of them are full-time?"
    solution: "The ratio of full-time to part-time is 1.5 to 1. To work with whole numbers, we can write this as 3:2. The total number of parts is $3 + 2 = 5$. The value of one part is $120 \\div 5 = 24$. Full-time employees are 3 parts, so $3 \\times 24 = 72$."
    answer: "72"
