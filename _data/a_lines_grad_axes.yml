  solution: "Rearrange: $y=-x$. Gradient is -1. Intercepts are at (0, 0)."
  answer: "Gradient: -1, Y-intercept: (0, 0), X-intercept: (0, 0)"
- question: "For the line $2x-3y=6$, find the gradient, y-intercept, and x-intercept."
  solution: "Rearrange: $2x-6=3y \\implies y=\\frac{2}{3}x-2$. Gradient is 2/3. Y-intercept is (0, -2). X-intercept is (3, 0)."
  answer: "Gradient: 2/3, Y-intercept: (0, -2), X-intercept: (3, 0)"
- question: "For the line $4x+5y=20$, find the gradient, y-intercept, and x-intercept."
  solution: "Rearrange: $5y=-4x+20 \\implies y=-\\frac{4}{5}x+4$. Gradient is -4/5. Y-intercept is (0, 4). X-intercept is (5, 0)."
  answer: "Gradient: -4/5, Y-intercept: (0, 4), X-intercept: (5, 0)"
- question: "For the line $y = -0.25x+1$, find the gradient, y-intercept, and x-intercept."
  solution: "Gradient is -0.25. Y-intercept is (0, 1). X-intercept is (4, 0)."
  answer: "Gradient: -0.25, Y-intercept: (0, 1), X-intercept: (4, 0)"
- question: "For the line $y=100-20x$, find the gradient, y-intercept, and x-intercept."
  solution: "Gradient is -20. Y-intercept is (0, 100). X-intercept is (5, 0)."
  answer: "Gradient: -20, Y-intercept: (0, 100), X-intercept: (5, 0)"
- question: "For the line $x=2y-6$, find the gradient, y-intercept, and x-intercept."
  solution: "Rearrange: $x+6=2y \\implies y=0.5x+3$. Gradient is 0.5. Y-intercept is (0, 3). X-intercept is (-6, 0)."
  answer: "Gradient: 0.5, Y-intercept: (0, 3), X-intercept: (-6, 0)"
- question: "For the line $x=10-y$, find the gradient, y-intercept, and x-intercept."
  solution: "Rearrange: $y=-x+10$. Gradient is -1. Y-intercept is (0, 10). X-intercept is (10, 0)."
  answer: "Gradient: -1, Y-intercept: (0, 10), X-intercept: (10, 0)"```
