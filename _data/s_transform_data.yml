- question: "A dataset has a median of -10. If every data point is multiplied by 2, what is the new median?"
  solution: "The median is scaled by the multiplication factor. New Median = -10 * 2 = -20."
  answer: "New Median = -20"
- question: "A dataset has a standard deviation of 4. If every data point is multiplied by 0.25, what is the new standard deviation?"
  solution: "The standard deviation is scaled by the multiplication factor. New SD = 4 * 0.25 = 1."
  answer: "New Standard Deviation = 1"
- question: "A dataset has a range of 8. If every data point is multiplied by 1.5, what is the new range?"
  solution: "The range is scaled by the multiplication factor. New Range = 8 * 1.5 = 12."
  answer: "New Range = 12"
- question: "A dataset has a variance of 16. If every data point is multiplied by 0.5, what is the new variance?"
  solution: "The variance is scaled by the square of the factor. New Variance = 16 * (0.5^2) = 4."
  answer: "New Variance = 4"
- question: "A dataset has a mean of 120. If every data point is divided by 12, what is the new mean?"
  solution: "The mean is scaled by the division factor. New Mean = 120 / 12 = 10."
  answer: "New Mean = 10"
- question: "A dataset has a standard deviation of 30. If every data point is divided by 2, what is the new standard deviation?"
  solution: "The standard deviation is scaled by the division factor. New SD = 30 / 2 = 15."
  answer: "New Standard Deviation = 15"
- question: "A dataset has a variance of 50. If every data point is divided by 5, what is the new variance?"
  solution: "The variance is scaled by the square of the division factor. New Variance = 50 / (5^2) = 2."
  answer: "New Variance = 2"
- question: "A dataset has a median of 1. If every data point is divided by 10, what is the new median?"
  solution: "The median is scaled by the division factor. New Median = 1 / 10 = 0.1."
  answer: "New Median = 0.1"
- question: "A dataset has an IQR of 100. If every data point is divided by 100, what is the new IQR?"
  solution: "The IQR is scaled by the division factor. New IQR = 100 / 100 = 1."
  answer: "New IQR = 1"
- question: "A dataset has a mean of 0 and a range of 20. Each data point is multiplied by 4 and then 100 is added. Find the new mean and range."
  solution: "The mean is affected by both operations. The range is only affected by multiplication. New Mean = (0 * 4) + 100 = 100. New Range = 20 * 4 = 80."
  answer: "New Mean = 100, New Range = 80"
- question: "A dataset has a median of 0 and a variance of 2. Each data point is multiplied by 5 and then 10 is subtracted. Find the new median and variance."
  solution: "The median is affected by both operations. The variance is only affected by multiplication. New Median = (0 * 5) - 10 = -10. New Variance = 2 * (5^2) = 50."
  answer: "New Median = -10, New Variance = 50"
- question: "A dataset has a mean of 30 and a standard deviation of 10. 30 is subtracted from each data point and it is then multiplied by 2. Find the new mean and standard deviation."
  solution: "The mean is affected by both operations. The SD is only affected by multiplication. New Mean = (30 - 30) * 2 = 0. New SD = 10 * 2 = 20."
  answer: "New Mean = 0, New Standard Deviation = 20"
- question: "A dataset has a median of 20 and an IQR of 10. 20 is subtracted from each data point and it is then divided by 10. Find the new median and IQR."
  solution: "The median is affected by both operations. The IQR is only affected by division. New Median = (20 - 20) / 10 = 0. New IQR = 10 / 10 = 1."
  answer: "New Median = 0, New IQR = 1"
- question: "A dataset has a mean of 100 and a variance of 100. 100 is added to each data point and it is then divided by 100. Find the new mean and variance."
  solution: "The mean is affected by both operations. The variance is only affected by division. New Mean = (100 + 100) / 100 = 2. New Variance = 100 / (100^2) = 0.01."
  answer: "New Mean = 2, New Variance = 0.01"
