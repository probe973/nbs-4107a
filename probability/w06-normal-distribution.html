  <!-- QUESTION 1 -->
  <li class="question-section">
    <p>These questions concern the standard normal distribution, Z, which has a mean $\mu=0$ and a variance $\sigma^2=1$, so you can write $Z \sim N(0,1)$. You will also consider the distribution of the length of donkey's tails, $D \sim N(35,16)$, that is the normal distribution with mean $\mu=35 \text{ cm}$ and variance $\sigma^2=16 \text{ cm}^2$. No tables or calculators are required for this first question.</p>
